For increasing the budget to $18000 to $20000 I took the following steps:
* I doubled the amount of DB instances
* I doubled the amount of EC2 instances and made them reserved instances
* I doubled the amount of application load balancers
All of those changes could potentially result in lower latencies due to more
capacity. However if there is not enough load, this will only generate more
costs.
