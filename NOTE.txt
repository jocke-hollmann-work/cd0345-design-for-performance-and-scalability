Task 2, to calculate Infrastructure Costs, is under-specified as it is only
known, that 50000 users will use the system, but neither how much they will
use it nor how the application will behave. Also normal you would do the
calculations based on your needs and not to have a certain price tag...

To have a realistic example, I would have needed a lot more input data, like
frequency of incoming requests, amount of data transferred (images? mostly
text?) and so on.
